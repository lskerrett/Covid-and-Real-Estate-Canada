# Modelling change of housing market due to COVID-19

## Description of the project

### Goal
In Canada, the job market is remarkably concentrated in the big cities of the provinces across the country. This situation leads to higher demand of real state and rent activity in such cities, and many developers rely on such predictable outcome to invest. However, the economy in 2020 has been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic which forced many to work from home, being no longer necessary to look for lodging in the big cities. In this situation, it is important for private developers to know if COVID-19 has affected significantly the housing market in big and small cities across Canada.

### The questions we hope to answer are: <br>

- Did the real state market was impacted positively or negatively by COVID-19?
- Is the impact different in small cities and big cities?
 
### Data source
