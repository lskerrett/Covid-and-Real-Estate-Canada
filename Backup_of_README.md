# Modelling change of housing market due to COVID-19

## Description of the project

### Goal
In Canada, the job market is remarkably concentrated in the big cities of the provinces across the country. This situation leads to higher demand of real state and rent activity in such cities, and many developers rely on such predictable outcome to invest. However, the economy in 2020 has been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic which forced many to work from home, being no longer necessary to look for lodging in the big cities. In this situation, it is important for private developers to know if COVID-19 has affected significantly the housing market in big and small cities across Canada.

### The questions we hope to answer are: <br>

- Did the real state market was impacted positively or negatively by COVID-19?
- Is the impact different in small cities and big cities?
 
### Data source

We will use data from 3 differents sources: <br>

-[Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/data-and-research) <br>
-[Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?subject_levels=46) <br>
-[Canadian Real Estate Association](https://creastats.crea.ca/en-CA/) <br>
-
### Data base samples:
Housing inventory clean <br>
New housing prices <br>
Canadian population 2011-2016 <br>

### Communication

Communication will be done via Slack and Zoom. We will meet at least twice a week

## Run chosen model algorithm

A combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques will be utilized to gain a better understanding of the impact that Covid-19 has had on the real estate market. Unsupervised machine learning will be utilized to first identify any strong relationships between features, and then supervised machine learning will be utilized to build a model which predicts the housing price index for a particular city. This trained supervised machine learning model will then be utilized to predict potential cities that have high chances of having their housing price index increase.
